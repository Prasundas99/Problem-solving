/*Alternative of IF else bt in large scale

Is switch more optimized than if?
A switch statement is usually more efficient than a set of nested ifs. ... The compiler can do this because it knows that the case constants are all the same type and simply must be compared for equality with the switch expression, while in case of if expressions, the compiler has no such knowledge.
