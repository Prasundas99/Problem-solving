/*
A Smith Number is a composite number whose sum of digits is equal to the sum of digits in its prime factorization.


Input  : n = 4
Output : Yes
Prime factorization = 2, 2  and 2 + 2 = 4
Therefore, 4 is a smith number

Input  : n = 6
Output : No
Prime factorization = 2, 3  and 2 + 3 is
not 6. Therefore, 6 is not a smith number
