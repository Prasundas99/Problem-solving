What is a Dynamic Array?
A dynamic array is quite similar to a regular array, but its size is modifiable during program runtime. DynamArray elements occupy a contiguous block of memory.

Once an array has been created, its size cannot be changed. However, a dynamic array is different. A dynamic array can expand its size even after it has been filled.

During the creation of an array, it is allocated a predetermined amount of memory. This is not the case with a dynamic array as it grows its memory size by a certain factor when there is a need.


Factors impacting performance of Dynamic Arrays
The arrayâ€™s initial size and its growth factor determine its performance. Note the following points:

If an array has a small size and a small growth factor, it will keep on reallocating memory more often. This will reduce the performance of the array.
If an array has a large size and a large growth factor, it will have a huge chunk of unused memory. Due to this, resize operations may take longer. This will reduce the performance of the array.

/*
In C++, memory is divided into two parts -

Stack - All the variables that are declared inside any function take memory from the stack.
Heap - It is unused memory in the program that is generally used for dynamic memory allocation.
